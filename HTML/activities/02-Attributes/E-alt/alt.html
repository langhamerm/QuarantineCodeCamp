            The alt Attribute

    The alt attribute specifies an alternative text to be used, if an image cannot be displayed.

    The value of the alt attribute can be read by screen readers. This way, someone "listening" to the webpage,
     e.g. a vision impaired person, can "hear" the element.


        <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">
