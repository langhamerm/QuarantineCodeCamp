    HTML Elements

An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and an end tag, with the content inserted in between:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>


The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag. -->


<!-- 

    Nested HTML Elements

 HTML elements can be nested (elements can contain elements).
 
 All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements. -->


<!-- 

    Empty HTML Elements

HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.

<br> is an empty element without a closing tag (the <br> tag defines a line break) -->
