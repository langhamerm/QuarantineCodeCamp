<!--        The HTML <script> Tag

    The <script> tag is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript).
    
    The <script> element either contains script statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.
    
    Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.
    
    To select an HTML element, JavaScript most often uses the document.getElementById() method.
    
    Add JavaScript using a script tag so that the div with the id of demo writes 
    "Hello JavaScript!" into an HTML element with id="demo":
