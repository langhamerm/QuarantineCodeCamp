<!--        Using The id Attribute

The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element (the value must be unique within the HTML document).

The id value can be used by CSS and JavaScript to perform certain tasks for the element with the specific id value.

In CSS, to select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

<!--        Difference Between Class and ID

An HTML element can only have one unique id that belongs to that single element, 
while a class name can be used by multiple elements.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Ids</title>

        <!-- Create an internal stylesheet -->

    </head>
    <body>

    <!-- Create 4 paragraph elements, and give them all different ids -->

    <!-- Then, in your internal stylehseet using those ids as selectors, 
        change the background color of those paragraphs to 4 different colors -->

     
    </body>
</html>
