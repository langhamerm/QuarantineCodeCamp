<!--        Using The class Attribute

The HTML class attribute is used to define equal styles for elements with the same class name.

So, all HTML elements with the same class attribute will get the same style. 
-->

<!--        Select Elements With a Specific Class

In CSS, to select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class.
-->

<!--        Multiple Classes

HTML elements can have more than one class name, each class name must be separated by a space. 
-->

<!--        Different Tags Can Share Same Class

Different tags, like <h2> and <p>, can have the same class name and thereby share the same style 
-->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Classes</title>

        <!-- Create an internal stylesheet -->

    </head>
    <body>

    <!-- Create 4 paragraph elements, 3 of which that share the same class name -->

    <!-- Then, in your internal stylehseet using that class name as the selector, 
        change the background color of those paragraphs to pink -->

     
    </body>
</html>
