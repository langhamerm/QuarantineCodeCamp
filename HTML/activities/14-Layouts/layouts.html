<!--        HTML Layout Elements

Websites often display content in multiple columns (like a magazine or newspaper).

HTML offers several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:

            HTML5 Semantic Elements	

<header> - Defines a header for a document or a section

<nav> - Defines a container for navigation links

<section> - Defines a section in a document

<article> - Defines an independent self-contained article

<aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)

<footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section

<details> - Defines additional details
    
<summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element -->


<!--        HTML Layout Techniques

    There are five different ways to create multicolumn layouts. Each way has its pros and cons:
    
        1. HTML tables (not recommended)
        2. CSS float property
        3. CSS flexbox
        4. CSS framework
        5. CSS grid
